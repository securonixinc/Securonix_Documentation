If any new content is available, it is displayed in the content category. You have to deploy the content before you can use it in SNYPR.
You can download and deploy the content from the Securonix content library using Menu &amp;gt; Admin &amp;gt; Content Management. The Content Update screen is displayed.
The Content Update screen provides the following:</description></item><item><title/><link>/docs/example/Synpr-Content/Getting_Started/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/example/Synpr-Content/Getting_Started/</guid><description>Commit Content # SNYPR content is categorized by functionality. Functionality is a category that defines a datasource type. For example: Web Proxy is a functionality and Blue Coat Proxy is a datasource. By categorizing datasources by functionality, SNYPR can apply similar parsers, policies, and threat models to all datasources with similar functionality.
The functionality determines what content is available when you import the datasource. For a list of functionality supported by SNYPR, see Supported Functionality.</description></item><item><title/><link>/docs/example/Web-Services/REST_api/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/example/Web-Services/REST_api/</guid><description>REST API Categories # This section includes a list of REST API categories and requests. Before running any APIs, you must generate a token using Generate Token API. Token is used for authentication. Once your token is expired, you must generate it.

However, you can decide if you want to commit any supporting information or not. The supporting information for policies are tier-2 checks and workflow, and for parser is data dictionary.
Committing Policy # To commit policies to the Securonix content library, perform the following:
Navigate to Menu &amp;gt; Admin &amp;gt; Content Management.</description></item><item><title/><link>/docs/example/Synpr-Content/Connectors/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/example/Synpr-Content/Connectors/</guid><description>Connectors # SNYPR provides out-of-box connectors to import activity events from various datasources. Before you can setup the ingestion process, you have to check if an out-of-box connector is available for the datasource. There are three scenarios that can occur:
The out-of-box connector is available. The out-of-box connector is available but parser is not available. The out-of-box connector is not available.</description></item><item><title/><link>/docs/example/Content-Management/New_Features/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/example/Content-Management/New_Features/</guid><description>New Features # Customers donâ€™t have an option to update customized securonix OOTB parsers. Application lacks ownership tracking of the parser at a granular level.
Resource groups require a certain level of customization specific to a customer or tenant. Eg: Geolocation Enrichment, IP Attribution, TPI enrichment,etc. Improved parser data flow and content management deploy logic allows the users to retain the Customer created content and receive updates to Securonix created content.</description></item><item><title/><link>/docs/example/Synpr-Content/Data-dictionary/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/example/Synpr-Content/Data-dictionary/</guid><description>Data Dictionary # Data Dictionary simplifies the ingestion, analytics, and hunting processes by providing consistent and easy to understand labels for data ingested from various datasources. These labels provide uniformity to data ingested from multiple datasources within a functionality.
Content developers can use these mapped labels to create policies that can be used for multiple datasources. This reduces the time and effort a content developer has to spend on creating policies for different datasources.</description></item><item><title/><link>/docs/example/hidden/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/example/hidden/</guid><description>This page is hidden in menu # Quondam non pater est dignior ille Eurotas # Latent te facies # Lorem markdownum arma ignoscas vocavit quoque ille texit mandata mentis ultimus, frementes, qui in vel.
