This employs granular tracking which was not available previously. Line Filters and Action Filters can be updated but Derived Fields and Categorization Enrichments are not tracked in this ownership change. Categorization Enrichments are restricted (covered under Restricted Changes below). However, this ownership tracking currently only applies to Securonix owned Parsers (i.e. starting with SCNX_ or having CRPid as less than 1 Million).\n2.1.1.2 Allowed Changes # Changes to Geolocation, TPI, Lookups, Activelists and IP Attribution are all allowed to Clients and do not require the creation of a CUST_ parser.\nFill in the relevant details then click Save \u0026amp; Next on the top right of the screen:\nOn the next screen (Parser Management), Click on Conditional Actions and then Add Condition:\nFill in the details as required and in the “Select Actions for Above Conditions” section, choose “Geolocate Attributes” or something else except the first 2 (Set Event Severity, Set Event Category) since those are restricted changes.

Finally, click on Save \u0026amp; Next at the top right of the screen:\nYou will see that a pop up screen will appear that says you can either Save the changes to overwrite the existing parser (since this is an Allowed Change) or choose Save As to make a new copy of the Parser:\n2.1.1.3 Restricted Changes # Categorization Enrichments are not allowed. For example, Set Event Severity and Set Event Category are not allowed to be changed by Clients. If a Client wants to modify these, they will be forced to create a CUST_ parser.\nFill in the relevant details then click Save \u0026amp; Next on the top right of the screen:\nOn the next screen (Parser Management), Click on Conditional Actions and then Add Condition:\nFill in the details as required and in the “Select Actions for Above Conditions” section, choose either “Set Event Severity” or “Set Event Category” since these 2 are restricted changes.

Finally, click on Save \u0026amp; Next at the top right of the screen:\nYou will see that a pop up screen will appear that says you need to Save the settings as a New Parser:\nThis is because this is a restricted change and will create a CUST_ parser instead of affecting the SCNX_ parser.\n2.2 From Content Admin Perspective # 2.2.1 Parsers # 2.2.1.1 New Improved Deploy Action # Till now the Deploy Parser action to update Parser used to overwrite any Line Filter Customizations that the client had made. The new improved deploy action allows clients to keep their own Line Filters customizations on Parsers and still get them updated to the newest versions when they are available. This is done by showing a popup when clicking the Deploy button which gives the client the choice to overwrite the Line Filters or not.\nHere, ticking the first option will overwrite the line filters that the customer might have modified (essentially replacing the parser with the latest OOTB parser) while unticking it will ensure that the parser is updated to the latest version while keeping the line filter customizations that the customer did as-is. The second option is basically a confirmation checkbox and the deploy button becomes clickable only when this is ticked.\n2.2.1.2 Manage Content # The Manage Content screen allows a Parser to be force deployed and resetted back to the Securonix OOTB Parser by reading the latest data from the Data folder and overwriting the customized data. This means any customization that the Client has done (and which may or may not have resulted in any corruption be it intentional or otherwise) will be wiped out and replaced with the OOTB Parser.\n2.2.1.3 Daily Housekeeping Job # A dedicated job that runs every 24 hours. This job will check if there are any new parsers in the CRP folders and automatically deploys them in the CRP table. This job also runs when a new datasource is added for the first time.\n2.2.2 Policies # 2.2.2.1 Manage Content # The Manage Content screen allows a Policy to be force deployed and resetted back to the Securonix OOTB Policy by reading the latest data from the Data folder and overwriting the customized data. This means any customization that the Client has done (and which may or may not have resulted in any corruption be it intentional or otherwise) will be wiped out and replaced with the OOTB Policy.\n2.2.2.2 Deprecate Policies # There are 2 ways to deprecate a policy:\nDevelopers can simply remove the config files corresponding to that policy from the SVN repository. This will automatically start the counter (in a range of 60-90 days). This is to ensure that clients have sufficient time to either clone the policy or create a duplicate version of the policy if they need it or they can modify and retain the policy.\nWe can set the configuration of the policy from the UI and set a user defined counter which can be any number of days (even less than 60 days if needed). This can be useful in case there is a vendor deprecation or functionality deprecation in play.\nTwo scenarios can arise here:\nIf there is a violation, preserve the violation, disable the policy and under “Policy Violation” show that policy is deprecated. Additionally, the user is not allowed to re-enable them.\nIf there is no violation, remove it under “Policy Violation”.\n"},{"id":7,"href":"/doc/docs/example/Synpr-Content/Data-dictionary/","title":"Data Dictionary","section":"Synpr Content","content":" Data Dictionary # Data Dictionary simplifies the ingestion, analytics, and hunting processes by providing consistent and easy to understand labels for data ingested from various datasources.

OEF uses common attributes to consistently use the same attribute in SNYPR to represent the same attributes from disparate data sources. This enables SNYPR to provide content for datasources based on their functionality, even if the datasources use entirely different conventions for their attributes.\nWhy is the OEF Important? # Many organizations have adopted big data technologies to build vast data lakes to store and process event data. The goal of the data lake is simple: store once and use multiple times.\nOEF provides a standardized framework for the storage, streaming, querying, and analyzing of all types of machine generated events. Events generated by devices, applications, network sensors, and other environment sensors must be stored, processed, queried, and analyzed in order to meet a number of objectives, such as:\nBusiness Process Monitoring Decision Making Performance Monitoring Security Monitoring Compliance requirements Fraud detection Forensic investigations Several well-known formats for structuring event data include Syslog, CLF, ELF, CEF, LEEF, CIM, CEE, IDMEF, etc. System and application developers may chose any of these formats when writing audit events or log messages, or can chose from their own format.\nNo one knows exactly how the data we are gather today will be used in the future, but by storing data in an OEF (the widely adopted standard), organizations can confidently control and use their data, no matter the analytical technique or technology that may come along.\n"},{"id":8,"href":"/doc/docs/example/Content-Management/","title":"Content Management","section":"Features Available","content":" Content Management # Content Management allows detection engineers to seamlessly deploy content (policies and parsers) in their environment.

ZapierWe can import data from Smartsheets, Totango on a continuous basis to Productboard with the help of their open API and Zapier to facilitate an integration. 4.1 Sample Zapier Integration:Open Zapier\nClick on create new Zap\nChoose required app ( for eg: Smartsheet ) to connect to Productboard Select event to create note in Productboard and authorise your account\nSet up a trigger which can be any action like new row added, row value updated (or anything similar to your app)\nNext, select Productboard as the other app and authorise your account\nChoose relevant fields to be mapped from your app choice to Productboard\nTest your connection\nNow anytime you add new information to your app, it gets added to Productboard automatically\nThese Zapier integrations can be used for other data platforms where we have a continuous influx of data and need it to be updated to Productboard as well.\nAdditionally, we can sort our input data as notes by using any of these filters and add them to collections for easier accessibility.\nFeatures section:The features section contains all of our projects ( currently: Content Management and Data Team only) and the relevant issues in them. You can link customer feedback/insight/request or any other data from Insights section to here. This is the place where we can prioritize issues and get a view of everything we have in plan for current and upcoming sprint.\nFor each feature idea in this section, we can assign priority as value and effort ( story points ) which would give us a Value effort score. We can also add a user impact score to this which reflects how many times a user has requested for a particular feature.\nFurthermore, we get similar filters like insights which enable us to sort these features based on any of the filter values:\nWe can sort features by team, sprints or status\nWe can identify certain company/customer segments and track the completion status of those features alone\nRoadmap:Roadmaps are used to identify direction, priorities, and progress of a product over time. They help to align the organization around short- and long-term goals for the product or project, and how they will be achieved.\nGood Roadmaps are:\nUp to date guide on helping achieve product vision\nUseful in showcasing product impact\nHelpful in facilitating collaboration and gives a clear sense of direction to the team\nA great tool to reflect customer feedback and support their concerns. Productboard can help with all of the above by providing an adaptable and easily modifiable roadmap.\nIn this section, we can get different views of our issues and feature stories and we can sort them however we want based on who we are presenting our Roadmap to. This section feature many filters which we can use to sort issues based on our preferences.\nWe can choose any particular roadmap of our preference depending on the audience and view our feature releases with timelines accordingly. The sprint backlog roadmap can be used to see what issues have been prioritized for what particular sprints and the feature timeline roadmap helps to see the high level feature releases.\nSharing roadmaps:We can export our roadmaps as pdf, png to be added to any presentation or we can make use of the copy link feature available under the share option to share a link through any communication channels. A more detailed walkthrough can be found in this recording:\nhttps://securonix.zoom.us/rec/share/Ue7MQ4aKY5lFluE4TSKbJmj-CSjEYXJ9Rz0SuiMC04R_bLoV54TLjNPBFjDfd98c.fUFNUrvbdqikK64E Passcode: s!2FPt=c\nThe above is a representation of our Roadmap which has been embedded to this confluence page.\nPortal:Portal is a flexible, interactive interface you can share with colleagues and/or customers to validate ideas and keep everyone informed. It can be used to used to collect feedback on ideas under consideration. All new ideas and feedback submitted on the Portal are routed back to the Insights board so they can be analysed alongside other inputs.\nTo add an idea:\nClick the plus icon at the bottom\nSelect feature idea to be displayed for internal/customer view.\nAdd to portal\nThen we can see the portal idea and the corresponding insights added for it.\nAction items for Productboard setup:Action
