# Synper Content

SNYPR Content is a set of out-of-the-box connectors, parsers, reports, dashboards, policies, and threat models for datasources that can be ingested and used in SNYPR. SNYPR 6.4 introduces Content Management to update and deploy content in a couple of steps. The Securonix content team has a master repository where they upload new content to share. Customers have their own local content repository in the file system located at "$SECURONIX_HOME/content/data". Content administrators or detection engineers can efficiently download new updates and deploy new content in their SNYPR environment.
